# Parallelized-Local-Binary-Pattern-Approach-for-Face-Recognition-System
The evolution and advancement in the field of technology over the last few years have been immense and the importance of computer vision and object detection has grown ever since. In computer vision, face recognition is one of the areas which has had prolific growth specifically because of its flexibility and ability to be applied to numerous domains in real world. There are many types of algorithmic implementations for the execution of a face recognition system. However, in order to obtain an extremely accurate and efficient performance, massive training datasets are needed and based on the number of epochs the training runs for, the time required for completion of the process increases drastically. This project proposes a face recognition algorithm which is called the Local Binary Pattern (LBP) approach. And in order to overcome the major time bound challenge mentioned earlier, the system proposed in this work is parallelized using multiple processes, i.e., a pool of processes, to train the model simultaneously. The paper also gives insights on some of the other existing algorithms with regards to face recognition, and also compares the proposed parallelized LBP model with the conventional algorithms based on its accuracy and performance.
